Hello, I'm **Minkyoung Shin**.

I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence at **Ajou University** in South Korea. With a strong interest in AI and system design, I enjoy creating innovative solutions that offer real-world convenience and meaningful impact.

My journey in tech has led me to develop a variety of AI-driven applications, including:
- A super-resolution powered idol stock option platform,
- A voice-guided navigation assistant for beginner drivers,
- A forward-obstacle detection system for the visually impaired.

These experiences have shaped my passion for pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve.

Academically, I hold a Bachelor's degree in **Electronic Engineering and Convergence Artificial Intelligence**, having completed a dual major program.

Currently, I am a research member of the **VSPL Lab**, focusing on:
- Building **domain-optimized anomaly image generation models** using diffusion techniques, and
- Developing **anomaly detection systems** tailored for industrial use cases.

Whether I'm writing code or collaborating with cross-functional teams, I always strive for **robust performance**, clear communication, and the practical deployment of AI technologies that matter.

Outside of work, I find joy in listening to music, practicing pilates, and watching mystery films. These hobbies fuel my creativity and help maintain a fresh perspective.

Lately, I’ve been diving deeper into **domain adaptation** and **class imbalance** challenges in industrial classification models — areas I believe are critical for real-world AI adoption.

Continuous learning and a multi-faceted approach are the cornerstones of my philosophy. I'm always exploring new trends and emerging innovations at the intersection of AI and industry.
